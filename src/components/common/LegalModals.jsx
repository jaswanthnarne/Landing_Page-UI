        <h2>1. End-To-End Security Model</h2>
        <p>Ethnotech Academy employs an industry-leading security architecture to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. All platform communication is encrypted enforcing TLS v1.2 at minimum for any connection processing identifiable or progress data.</p>

        <h2>2. Platform Access Security</h2>
        <p>Accessing our platform relies on secure sessions, multi-factor verification options, and validation. Attempts to bypass access controls or use headless automation are restricted.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Handling & Safe Storage</h2>
        <p>Our database clusters process data inside virtual private networks (VPCs) without public internet access boundaries. Platform content, user answers, scores, and identifiable student entries interact only across authenticated internal microservices. Data at rest is encrypted according to standard AES-256 regulations.</p>

        <h2>4. Identity Verification</h2>
        <p>User and instructor dashboards rely strictly on JSON Web Tokens (JWT) incorporating brief expiry cycles. Refresh tokens are dynamically validated preventing persistent state hijacking attacks. Access scopes check role-based allowances dynamically at endpoint levels.</p>

        <h2>5. Vulnerability Management</h2>
        <p>Ethnotech Academy runs comprehensive penetration tests routinely. Any critical infrastructure patching and framework-level security advisories are actively handled by our system orchestration teams to ensure dependencies carry zero known exploits.</p>
